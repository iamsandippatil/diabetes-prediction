# Diabetes Prediction Application

This repository contains a **Streamlit** web application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health metrics. The application uses a machine learning model to make predictions.

## Features

- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Input fields for various health parameters such as age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.
- Real-time prediction of diabetes risk.
- Lightweight and easy to deploy.
